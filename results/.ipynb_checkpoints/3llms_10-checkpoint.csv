"Mr. Wei, roughly what aspect are you referring to?"
"There are some searches on Twitter, monitoring k."
I'll find you an account and have you take a look.
Is a voice call convenient?
""
"Hello Mr. Zhou, I have a few numbers here I'd like you to help me check."
"Mr. Wei, please send it to me."

"Push all accounts, the last one was created using a g email address."

Thank you.
"Also, if I want to create a platform targeting Facebook, approximately how much would it cost and how long would it take? Currently, do you have any mature and useful products on your side? Could you please send a simple introductory document?"
We haven't researched the Facebook side much yet.
"Account TGtadie, phone: 18510867099, name: Wang Ning"
Are there any other people?
How much would it cost to purchase this platform?
"The other ones didn't go through, this is for 10,000 valid searches per year."
How much is it per query for a single service?
We haven't sold single instances of this yet.
"Once the epidemic is over, can we meet to discuss in detail? If we find that person, will there be any additional extended information?"
""
Can you see if there's a way to look into this person?
"Regarding fb, we are looking to initiate a project, so we reached out to you to understand the market price."
Has this been checked yet?
"Okay, thanks bro, feel free to contact me anytime you need anything recently."
[Joined hands]
"I just reported to the boss, and he asked me to first record today's results and then see the effect. Also, I will be giving you another batch recently, around 100 or so. Let's see the probability and accuracy of getting results, hope you understand."
"Too many, it won't get approved by company procedures."
So approximately how many would be within your capacity? The boss also wants to see how the results turn out.
The usual success rate is between 20~30%.
"Okay, thank you. I'll report to the big boss tomorrow. If he still wants us to cooperate and try it out, I'll let you know."
Okay.
"I‚Äôll try to talk to the boss and keep the test to within 20 accounts, so it won‚Äôt be too difficult for you, right?"
"We tested today, didn't we [grinning face]"
"Haha, it hasn't yet moved to real people, and still needs to move from online to a next phase involving real-world application, including the final results. Today, when reporting to the big boss, he specifically proposed finding a few units to each provide some accounts, to see how many can be run simultaneously, so we can measure the final results in a practical setting. We also need to get him to change his thinking ‚Äì technology changes lives [cheeky grin]."
Um/Okay/Got it.
Thanks bro. Let's hope we have more opportunities for multifaceted collaboration in the future.
"Okay, leader."
"We're all colleagues, don't say that. I'm also being pressured by the big boss and have no choice [bowing hands]."
"Hey brother, sorry to bother you. Does your team do research on the connections between websites? I have a few websites that seem to be related, but lack the technical support to pinpoint exactly how they're connected. See if your team handles this kind of work."
I've done some target research reports for other AQs before.
""
I'll gather information about a few websites and send it to you. See if your side can produce a research report. Wang's line is also verifying this simultaneously.
Do you have any previous reference reports? I can tell if we can do it by taking a look.
"No, I'll organize it shortly, please take a look and see if you can do it."
Okay.
""
Can you take a look at this and see if it's doable?
"Please be as detailed as possible, there's no rush. First, take a look and see if it's doable."
"The second item isn't a big problem, the first item is more difficult."
"Let's establish a cooperative relationship first, then these things are easy to discuss [grinning face]."
"Okay, please send me a list of the specific tasks you can handle so I can report to my boss."
""
"Also, can you do this website?"
"We generally do project packages, and don't really do individual services."
Doing things one by one is too tiring.
"Okay, I also want to do service packages."
How much per year üí∞
Generally a few hundred.
"We'll report this afternoon, can you simply list what you can do and the price for each?"
It mainly depends on the specific content.

"Brother, please send me a copy of your company profile and product introduction, I need it to write a report."
"Okay, just a bit busy."
"No problem, thanks, sorry to bother you."
"Brother, can you see the email address that account was bound to yesterday? Or can you see the private messages within the account on your end?"
I can't see that.
Can't you see the email used during registration?
Yes.
Okay.
Have you found the person?
"Not yet, let's verify the periphery first."
Basically no problem.
We just need to confirm whether this account or this mobile number is currently in use.

"Mr. Wei, please check."
Okay.
""
Seems like it can't open.
That one can be opened from outside the country.
It's a website of East Turkestan.
"Brother, we've identified that previous account. The phone number has had several owners, and the current user on Twitter isn't this Wang. Do you have any other evidence to corroborate this?"
The only thing certain is that the phone number linked to this Twitter account is correct.
"The phone number was definitely correct during registration, I suspect the Twitter account has been logging in with email ever since. I remember seeing in the introduction that your system has the ability to check his direct messages, right?"
The private message function needs further integration to be done.
"If you buy the service, it should all be included in the service, with 1000 valid queries."
This doesn't include that.
Different functional modules
Does this function require separate payment?
Yes.
"How much would your push service including 1000 requests, plus all services for a year cost?üí∞"
The private message module is sold as a product.
"I understand. I'm currently working on a budget and would like to know the annual cost of your system, including all modules related to the push notifications mentioned in the documentation, with 1000 queries included."
"If configured like that, 40 [folded hands]"
"How much would it cost to do business for just one website, specifically to get the logs?"
Needs specific goals for specific evaluation.
"Roughly then, I‚Äôll include it in the budget."
50+ (or 50 and up)
Just for one would it start at 50?
"Let's quote it like this for now, actually we don't do this kind of service individually."
"üëå, understood."
Doing it one by one would be a loss [ÊçÇËÑ∏]
"We also want to do a package deal, let's discuss it in person after the epidemic ends."
"Okay, let's roughly report the budget first, and we can discuss the rest later."
"Okay, no problem, thanks. Regarding the website I sent over last time, is there a possibility of moving forward with it?"
"Brother, can you handle Gmail accounts? What's the success rate?"
Haven't done much of that.
"I previously saw in your introduction that you had technology in this area, mainly for Google email."
"Um, but that's a product."
""
"Mr. Zhou, does your company do WhatsApp products?"
"Hello Mr. Wei, we don't have that."
Do you know of any companies in China that make this kind of software?
Haven't heard of it.
"Okay, thanks bro, are you still in Chengdu?"
Yes.
"Beijing hasn't been cleared yet, we can't travel for work. I'll contact you when we can."
Okay.
"Brother, will you be in Chengdu all of June?"
Around mid-June in Chengdu.
Can we hang out?
"After the Two Sessions are over, we should be able to travel. If I can go, I‚Äôll bring the leader and connect directly with you to try and get a project done this year, and we can take it slow after that."
"When the time comes, please introduce more products that showcase our company's unique capabilities."
"Okay, come eat hotpot."
"üòÑ, the main thing is to get things done, help each other out, and we can hold off on the hot pot. I've always felt bad about it, especially since the pandemic prevented us from going."
[evil laugh]
"There's one more thing. I have a lead number related to the Two Sessions, would you mind helping me look into it first?"
It might not be possible to pull it off.
"That's okay, because when reporting to the leaders, I also said there's a fifty percent chance of success[grinning]"
That's pretty amazing.
It's not that high.
Nationally leading [folded hands]

Please check this account and see.
Thanks bro.
Couldn't find it.
"Got it, thanks."
